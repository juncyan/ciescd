## MLCD

The paddle implementation for **CD_MSAM** 

## Requirements
- Python 3.10
- paddle 3.0.0


## Datasets
### Macao Land Change Detection (MLCD) Dataset
The MLCD utilizes imagery sourced from Google Earth Engine, covering a period of 15 years from 2008 to 2023. By precisely annotating these images, we have created a comprehensive dataset for sea-land change, focusing on the geographical evolution of reclaimed areas and the dynamics of surrounding vegetation coverage. This dataset includes 10,000 pairs of $256 \times 256$ images with a spatial resolution ranging from 0.5 to 2 m, providing valuable resources for studying coastal and land transformations.
